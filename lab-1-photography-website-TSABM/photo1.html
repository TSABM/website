	<h2>About us</h2>
	
	<p>Have you ever had the primal urge to doodle all over your childrens baby photos? If so you are like us, we saw an extreme dearth in all the internet of hastily edited baby photos. But fear not, we and our team of talented experts have come to the rescue. Using advanced photo editing technology and years of industry experience we have discovered the scientific formula that combines the cuteness of a baby and the awesomeness of doodles. Whith our help and a small monthly donation of 9.99 (insert currency here) you can help us make the internet a truly better place.</p>
	<h2>Our Founder</h2>
	<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
